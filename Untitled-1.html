                    <p class="image-text">Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as "Straw Hat Luffy" or simply "Straw Hat", is the founder, captain, and strongest combatant of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates. He fearlessly pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to become the new Pirate King and reach a further, untold dream (currently known to only his crew, family and closest friends). He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world. 
                   Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon and grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp and as such is a member of the Clan of D. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly Dadan, under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the late Portgas D. "Fire Fist" Ace and Sabo. However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate "Red-Haired" Shanks, who (unwittingly) enabled him to eat the Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber, 
                   sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate. As a pirate, Luffy has actively opposed countless regional, national, and global powers, beginning with several established East Blue pirates and extending to the Marines, the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, the World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the New World. Despite his young age and relatively short career, he has triumphed 
                   over a majority of these, successfully invading and indirectly causing the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaping the impregnable Impel Down, enabling several key developments in the Summit War of Marineford, and defeating three Warlords and an Emperor in direct combat. At the same time, he carries a great penchant for attracting friends and allies; in addition to personally engaging every member of his crew, he has earned regard and gratitude among many nations, fellow pirates, the Revolutionary 
                   Army, and even several Marines.  Luffy has gained wide infamy through his accomplishments, heritage, and general recklessness, drawing many large bounties as well as the focused hostility of the World Government, Marine Headquarters, and Fleet Admiral Sakazuki in particular. Currently, he is recognized as a central member of the Worst Generation, the unwilling leader of the seven-crew Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and—in wake of defeating Kaidou during the Raid on Onigashima—one of the Four Emperors, 
                   with a bounty of Beli3,000,000,000. Upon the awakening of the Gomu Gomu no Mi after centuries, Luffy is also heralded by a few as the second coming of Joy Boy.</p>

                     <p class="image-text">Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto’s pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha‘s monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).
                  Naruto was serialized in Shueisha’s magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of the series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. The English dub
                   was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over to Adult Swim‘s Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over from the first episode. The English dub is still airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day. Viz Media began streaming the anime series on their streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012 on 99 episodes, and ended in March 2016, after 338 episodes. Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies and twelve 
                   original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies. Viz Media licensed the manga and anime for North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada in 2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The films and most OVAs from the series were also released by 
                   Viz, with the first film premiering in movie theaters. The story of Naruto continues with Naruto’s son, Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations: Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of following his father’s. Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series in history having 250 million copies in circulation worldwide in 47 countries and regions, with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media’s best-selling 
                   manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga’s character development, strong storylines, and well-executed fight scenes, though some felt the fight scenes slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.</p>
